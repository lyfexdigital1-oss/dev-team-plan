# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Development Team

## Overview
This plan outlines the workflow for a small development team (3 members) using AI tools to enhance productivity and decision-making. The team will operate in **1-week sprints** and use a **Kanban board** for daily task management.

***

## Team Structure
- **Team Size**: 3 developers (roles may be flexible: Full-Stack, Backend, AI/ML Specialist)
- **AI Assistance**: Integrated for code review, task estimation, and documentation generation.

***

## Sprint Structure
### 1. Sprint Planning (Day 1)
- Define sprint goals and deliverables.
- Break down user stories/tasks and prioritize using AI-estimated complexity.
- Assign tasks to Kanban columns (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).

### 2. Daily Kanban Workflow (Days 2–7)
- **Stand-Up (morning)**: Quick team sync, review yesterday's progress, surface blockers.
- **Task Updates**: Move cards on the Kanban board as tasks progress.
- **AI Role**:
  - Suggest optimal task sequencing.
  - Flag bottlenecks or overdue tasks based on activity patterns.
  - Automated documentation for completed tasks.

### 3. Ongoing Collaboration
- Use AI-powered chat for Q&A and code suggestions.
- AI monitors code changes for potential issues/security concerns.

### 4. Sprint Review & Retrospective (End of Week)
- Demo completed work.
- Collect feedback (from team and users as appropriate).
- AI creates summary of achievements, issues, and suggested improvements.
- Team reflects on process efficiency and updates Kanban workflows if needed.

## Example Weekly Kanban Board Columns

| To Do        | In Progress  | Review       | Done         |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Story A      | Story B      | Story C      | Story D      |
| Bug #124     | Story E      | Bug #125     | Story F      |

## AI Integration Points

- **Task estimation:** AI provides time and complexity analysis for new tasks.
- **Code review:** AI flags errors, suggests improvements as pull requests are opened.
- **Documentation:** Automatic generation of release notes and code comments.
- **Metrics:** AI generates weekly dashboards (velocity, completed tasks, code quality).

## Sample Weekly Timeline

| Day                | Activity                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Monday             | Sprint planning, Kanban setup                     |
| Tuesday–Thursday   | Development, AI-assisted reviews, daily stand-ups |
| Friday             | Final code reviews, documentation, demo           |
| Saturday           | Sprint retrospective, update Kanban config        |
| Sunday             | (Optional) Team rest or training                  |

## Best Practices

- Limit work-in-progress (WIP) to avoid overload; let AI help enforce.
- Use short feedback loops—let AI surface issues early.
- Encourage team to contribute to AI training datasets for improvements.
- Regularly iterate on Kanban workflow based on AI retrospectives.

***

This plan is designed for **high transparency, rapid iteration, and maximum leverage of AI capabilities**, making it ideal for small, agile teams working in fast-paced environments.
