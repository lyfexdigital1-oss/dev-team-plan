# Project Plan: AI-Assisted Development Team

## Overview
This plan outlines the workflow for a small development team (3 members) using AI tools to enhance productivity and decision-making. The team will operate in **1-week sprints** and use a **Kanban board** for daily task management.

***

## Team Structure
- **Team Size**: 3 developers (roles may be flexible: Full-Stack, Backend, AI/ML Specialist)
- **AI Assistance**: Integrated for code review, task estimation, and documentation generation.

***

## Sprint Structure
### 1. Sprint Planning (Day 1)
- Define sprint goals and deliverables.
- Break down user stories/tasks and prioritize using AI-estimated complexity.
- Assign tasks to Kanban columns (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).

### 2. Daily Kanban Workflow (Days 2–7)
- **Stand-Up (morning)**: Quick team sync, review yesterday's progress, surface blockers.
- **Task Updates**: Move cards on the Kanban board as tasks progress.
- **AI Role**:
  - Suggest optimal task sequencing.
  - Flag bottlenecks or overdue tasks based on activity patterns.
  - Automated documentation for completed tasks.

### 3. Ongoing Collaboration
- Use AI-powered chat for Q&A and code suggestions.
- AI monitors code changes for potential issues/security concerns.

### 4. Sprint Review & Retrospective (End of Week)
- Demo completed work.
- Collect feedback (from team and users as appropriate).
- AI creates summary of achievements, issues, and suggested improvements.
- Team reflects on process efficiency and updates Kanban workflows if needed.

***
Team is only working **Monday to Friday**, with **Friday as a half day (4 hours)**, the project plan needs to be adjusted so that sprint planning, development, reviews, and retrospectives all fit into that condensed schedule.  

***

## **Adjusted Weekly Timeline (1-Week Sprint)**

| Day      | Hours | Activity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Monday** | Full day | **Sprint Planning (AM)** – Define goals, break stories into tasks with AI estimation, set up Kanban. <br> **Development (PM)** – Start high-priority tasks. |
| **Tuesday** | Full day | Development + AI-assisted code reviews, daily stand-up (AM), Kanban updates. |
| **Wednesday** | Full day | Development focus, AI monitors bottlenecks, daily stand-up. |
| **Thursday** | Full day | Finish feature work, start code review/testing. AI generates documentation for completed tasks. |
| **Friday** | 4 hours | **Morning:** Wrap up remaining reviews & bug fixes. <br> **Late morning:** Sprint Demo & Retrospective. No sprint work in the afternoon. |
| **Saturday/Sunday** | — | No work time — AI can run automated reports or alerts asynchronously for Monday review. |

***

## **Key Changes for Shorter Work Week**
1. **Front-load development tasks** early in the week (Mon–Wed), leaving Thu–Fri for review, testing, and wrap-up.
2. Move **Sprint Review & Retrospective** to Friday morning to align with your reduced Friday hours.
3. Use AI to help **prep sprint planning in advance** (e.g., backlog grooming on Thursday or Friday afternoon from the previous sprint).
4. Keep **WIP (Work in Progress) limits tighter**, since you have ~36 working hours per member per week instead of 40.

***

## **Example Kanban Workflow**
**To Do → In Progress → Review/Test → Done**

- **Monday:** Fill "To Do" with prioritized tasks; assign work.
- **Tuesday–Wednesday:** Move tasks to "In Progress"; AI monitors progress.
- **Thursday:** Push most work to "Review/Test".
- **Friday morning:** Complete tasks, mark as "Done", AI generates sprint summary.

***

## **AI Assistance Points (Optimized for Time)**
- **Monday morning:** Suggest optimal priority ordering so you start strongest.
- **Mid-week:** Flag at-risk tasks so they can be addressed before Thursday.
- **Friday early morning:** Auto-generate release notes and a retrospective outline for the team

## AI Integration Points

- **Task estimation:** AI provides time and complexity analysis for new tasks.
- **Code review:** AI flags errors, suggests improvements as pull requests are opened.
- **Documentation:** Automatic generation of release notes and code comments.
- **Metrics:** AI generates weekly dashboards (velocity, completed tasks, code quality).

## Sample Weekly Timeline

| Day                | Activity                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Monday             | Sprint planning, Kanban setup                     |
| Tuesday–Thursday   | Development, AI-assisted reviews, daily stand-ups |
| Friday             | Final code reviews, documentation, demo           |
| Saturday           | Sprint retrospective, update Kanban config        |
| Sunday             | (Optional) Team rest or training                  |

## Best Practices

- Limit work-in-progress (WIP) to avoid overload; let AI help enforce.
- Use short feedback loops—let AI surface issues early.
- Encourage team to contribute to AI training datasets for improvements.
- Regularly iterate on Kanban workflow based on AI retrospectives.

***

This plan is designed for **high transparency, rapid iteration, and maximum leverage of AI capabilities**, making it ideal for small, agile teams working in fast-paced environments.
